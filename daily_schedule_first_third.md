* #### Thursday, Feb. 27 &mdash; The fourth book of *Middlemarch*
  &mdash; Drew an extended family tree of the characters in *Middlemarch*, including non-familial relations (e.g. Caleb working for Brooke and Chettam; Lydgate as Casaubon's doctor) &mdash; The three love problems (Causabon & Dorothea, Lydgate & Rosamond, Will and Dorothea) &mdash; The nature of Will's relationship with Dorothea &mdash; "Ardent" and "ardour" as key words in *Middlemarch* - Dorothea, Lydgate, and Will all described as ardent, having ardor: what unites these characters? How are these characters related to the character type delineated in the Prelude, in which "ardour" and "ardent" also appear? &mdash; What do we make of Dorothea describing Causabon's labor as "ardent"? &mdash; Briefly mentioned: Joshua Riggs, the Dagleys, Brooke as landlord, Brooke's political aspirations

   Left undiscussed: Ch. 41 on Casaubon ("I know no speck so troublesome as self." Compare with passage from ch. 29 "to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to be liberated from a small hungry shivering self.") 

   Reminder to reread the Prelude, ch. 10 on Will and ch. 15 on Lydgate.

### Week 8 &mdash; *Middlemarch*, Bks. 5 & 6
* #### Tuesday, March 4 &mdash; The fifth book of *Middlemarch*
    Brief overview of "The Dead Hand" &mdash; Based on the observation in ch. 15 that "character too is a process and unfolding," we examined how two characters have unfolded so far: Will Ladislaw and Tertius Lydgate. In small groups, students considered how Ladislaw was described in ch. 10 and Lydgate in ch. 15. They then considered how these characters had unfolded by Book Five. Some of the dangers forecast for Lydgate in ch. 15 threaten to become realized--Rosamond dislikes Lydgate's medical career and Lydgate is in debt. As for Ladislaw, particular attention was paid to a passage (pp. 432-33 in our edition) in which "he was beginning thoroughly to like the work" and had given up, at least for a moment, "dilettantism."

  Students urged to pay close attention to the description of Dorothea's changing life, p. 433.
